1) Week 2 - Self-Portrait
https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2563538

This output creates a bunch of shapes with different colours that make up a self-portrait of myself.
I chose this output because it was the first project I put alot of my effort into and was proud of it.
It was really difficult placing the shapes in the exact places I wanted especially the points on the triangles.
I would like to try this again but add little animations to the hair, eyes or body.


2) Week 3 - Beyond the Stars
https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2573675

This project is about a rainbow character that is flying through space with a particle emitter in the centre to mimic stars flying past.
I added a overlay to show the title, controls and last key being pressed and the background changes pictures/locations.
I chose this output because it taught me many concepts such as arrays, constructing classes, for loops and overall logic in piecing everything together.
I spent alot of hours into this project and the learning curve was really difficult and would not ever try and learn everything like this again.

3) Week 5 - The 2D Life
https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2590641

In this output I tried to imitate a side scrolling 2d effect of some hills and mountains in the background with a day night cycle.
I chose this output because when I learnt in class how to use noise I was interested in how I could recreate minecraft like terrain.
I also liked how simple the code was to create the side scrolling effect. 
Next time I would like to add a playable character that can jump through obstacles.


Touch Designers Outputs:
4) Week 8 - RGB Playing Card

This output is of a card floating with rainbow effects and a scrolling background on the card.
I picked this one because I have always liked scrolling GUI effects in games and wondered if I could recreate it, I also like the rainbow outline.
Next time I would like to create a full menu and overlay GUI for a game with floating and scrolling animations and shining effects.

5) Week 9 - Audio Visualizer

For this output I put together a few litle projects that reacted to the audio in different ways.
I enjoyed making this project and all the different ways I could make audio reactive effects.
Things got really messy and I started lacking in giving operators proper names for what they do.
I learnt that I have to keep my scenes clean and organized at all times if I want smooth development for big projects.

6) Week 10 - Sega

In this project I utilized instancing to create a grid of audio reactive cubes with a camera rotating the centre of the scene.
I chose this project because I learnt more about the geo, camera and light COMP's.
I also learnt how to organize my operators by placing them inside annotate COMP's which helped alot visually.
